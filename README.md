## SciQi's README
Hi. I am a university student studying Electronic Systems Engineering. If asked "What are you interested in learning?", I would respond with "Everything". Currently, I am learning about Embedded Realtime Software Development. My favorite hobby to spend time on is tinkering with personal projects. The current hobby project I am working on is an autonomous garden using parts from a 3-in-1 soil sensor to monitor soil moisture, light, and pH levels. 
### Fun fact
I like listening to many genres of music, but I only binge one artist at a time until I get tired of them.
